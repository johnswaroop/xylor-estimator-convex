# Basic Development Rules

## Server Management

- **NEVER start the development server** - it's always running in the background
- Don't run `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, or similar commands
- The dev server is persistent and doesn't need to be restarted

## Code Quality

- Always use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Prefer `const` over `let` when variables don't change
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add proper error handling and validation

## File Organization

- Keep components organized in appropriate directories
- Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)
- Import from the closest relative path when possible

## Development Workflow

- Test changes incrementally
- Use the browser's dev tools for debugging
- Check console for errors and warnings before considering tasks complete

## Convex Best Practices

- Use proper Convex query and mutation patterns
- Handle loading and error states appropriately
- Validate data at the boundaries (client and server)
